A first project for Object-Oriented Programming II at UPIKE

This repository has a file called Roster.md. Currently it only has my name. What I would like each of you to do is:

1.  Fork this repository.

2.  In your version, add your name. Make sure there is a blank line between names.

3.  Submit a pull request to have your addition included in my repository.

I will then put them all together so that when we're done, everyone's name is on it.
